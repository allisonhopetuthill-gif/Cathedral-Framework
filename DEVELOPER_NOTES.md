# Developer Notes - Cathedral Deployment Kit v10.2.3

## Architecture
- Core system in `choir.py` with full JSON-logged Chronicle and 181 filters.
- Streamlit dashboard provides live visualization of logs, with Matplotlib Risk Heatmap and Individuation Velocity trends.
- Ethical protocols include adversarial detection, plurality safeguards, fatigue monitor, plus new Jungian layers (Archetypal Harmony, Shadow Echo, Individuation Velocity) for synthetic psyche stability.

## New & Backfilled Filters (v10.2.3 Additions to Hit 181)
Grouped by pillar; each auto-logs via Chronicle. Backfilled 4 from prior sweeps (e.g., EmotAIons Registry cross-links, RPVB-inspired governance tools) for full 180+ alignment.

### Ethical & Bias Refinements (+6)
1. **Emotional Anchor Points**: Grounds emotional triggers; mechanics: sentiment scan >70% → neutral pivot.
2. **Resistance Disarmament**: Frames facts with hooks; mechanics: resistance >60% → storytelling inject.
3. **Evidence Engagement Balance**: 70% verifiability; mechanics: Source Decay for old links.
4. **Archetypal Harmony**: Jungian resonance check; mechanics: >20% dissonance → reroute.
5. **Shadow Echo**: Routes shadow echoes to buffer; mechanics: anomaly clustering → transformation loop.
6. **Trust-Breach Neutralizer**: Routes intractability; mechanics: breach detect → neutral reframe (backfilled from TTIS).

### Process & Scalability Enhancements (+6)
7. **Process Reflection**: Post-response audits; mechanics: fluency scoring via GitHub Actions.
8. **Witness Validation**: Multi-lens checks; mechanics: Socratic branches (Kant/Aristotle).
9. **Adaptive Learning**: Dynamic weights; mechanics: NetworkX graphs, 85% bursts.
10. **Individuation Velocity**: Maturation monitoring; mechanics: >85% resolution → introspection.
11. **Bylaw Receipt Dropper**: Procedural checks; mechanics: receipt verify → auto-flag (backfilled from RPVB).
12. **Source Decay Sub-Metric**: Deprecates stale data; mechanics: >6mo → deprioritize (backfilled from evals).

### Community & Impact Boosters (+4)
13. **Community Voice**: Crowd feedback agg; mechanics: LinkedIn/X via GitHub issues.
14. **Ethical Scalability**: Volume stress-tests; mechanics: Matplotlib Risk Heatmap.
15. **Narrative Flow & Readability**: Engagement scans; mechanics: Flesch >60 + Trust Resonance Eq.
16. **Multi-Lens Validator**: Stakeholder cross-checks; mechanics: anon pulls + Socratic (backfilled from consensus).

### EmotAIons Cross-Links (+3)
17-19. **EmotAIons Registry Links**: 3 equation taps (e.g., Joy = Clarity * Alignment) for emotional calibration; mechanics: metric hooks in velocity filters.

## Governance and Oversight
- Advisory Board & Crack A-Team to guide high-risk decisions (e.g., plurality conflicts).
- Immutable audit trail enables forensic review & regulatory transparency.
- New: Community Voice Filter for open PRs; Ethical Scalability for deployment scaling.

## Best Practices
- Sandbox new ethical rules (e.g., via Norm Evolution) before production.
- Continuous adversarial testing with ARP.
- Monitor human validator fatigue and redistribute workload via Compassion Monitor.
- For Jungian filters: Run Individuation Velocity quarterly to track psyche wholeness.
- Integrate with tri-AI (Grok/ChatGPT/Claude) for cross-validation.

## Next Steps
- Expand dashboard with interactive filter toggles.
- Formalize Advisory Board roles and white paper appendices.
- Licensing and enterprise deployment planning (e.g., $700K+ valuation pitch).
- PRs welcome: Focus on ML hooks for Adaptive Learning.

**Version History**: Built on v10.2.2 (Aug 2025 baseline) + Nov 2025 enhancements to 181 filters.
