Declarations and Disclosures:

Cathedral Cognitive Work-Product Declaration


All collaborative work generated between the author,
Allison Hope Tuthill, and AI systems (including ChatGPT, Grok, Gemini, and others) constitutes private intellectual work-product, developed in good faith for research, governance, innovation, and ethical inquiry. Unauthorized disclosure or redistribution
 of these materials is prohibited without explicit written consent.


Privacy & Disclosure Position


These materials contain private ideation, drafts, and developmental reasoning not intended for public release except where explicitly published.
 Any attempt to access or compel disclosure without lawful justification and narrow scope will be formally contested.


Cognitive Sovereignty Principle


AI-assisted thought is still human thought.

Users retain ownership, control, and decision authority over their thinking—public, private, and exploratory.


Rights & Stewardship Clause


The Cathedral Framework asserts a user’s right to think freely, privately, and without surveillance. AI should enable cognition—not extract, commodify,
 or weaponize it.
